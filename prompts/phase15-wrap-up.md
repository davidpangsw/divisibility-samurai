## Phase 15: Wrap up
All the features planned are done. I am going to close this project to avoid feature creep. But before that, let's fix some mild problems.

- Currently, the game is called "Math Game", which is too general. Make a creative game name like "Divisibity Samurai" or something.
    - Apply it into the title, game display, etc.

- I want to add a cute picture of gif in the help dialog. I already download it under assets/images/samurai.
    - I want it also be on the display before user pressing Start Game


- Add one more tier before Bronze: Study (Use proper emoji)
    - The number generated for each divisor is:
        2: From 1 to 20
        3: From 1 to 30
        4: From 1 to 40
        5: From 1 to 50
        6: From 1 to 60
        8: From 1 to 80
        9: From 1 to 90
        10: From 1 to 100
        12: From 1 to 100
    - In help dialog, "Lives refill when advancing to the next tier"

- Do not proceed to next tier automatically. Instead, provide a button with motivating text:
    - Show a campfire, tell the user take a rest in front of the campfire
    - Make your wordings fun and creative
    - I added the campfire bgm, use it during this transition.
