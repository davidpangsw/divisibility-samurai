## Phase 15: Wrap up
All the features planned are done. I am going to close this project to avoid feature creep. But before that, let's fix some mild problems.

- Currently, the game is called "Math Game", which is too general. Make a creative game name like "Divisibity Samurai" or something.
    - Apply it into the title, game display, etc.

- I want to add a cute picture of gif in the help dialog. I already download it under assets/images/samurai.
