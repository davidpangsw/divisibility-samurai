## Slashing Sound effect; Mobile environment; Small UI Changes; difficulty adjustments
- Mobile environment
    - If the user is using mobile, it needs to press instead of hovering. Is it possible?
    - Play area is width 360, height 480. Is it capable for most mobile? what is the smallest size of mobile that is common now?
    - Make sure the blocks bounces at both left and right edge.

- Difficulty adjustment
    - Bronze require 5 corrects to proceed levels
    - Silver require 4
    - Gold requires 3

- Sound effects
    - I am poor, I have no money. You need to find some free ways. (I don't mind a little bit quoting or referencing)
    - Apply sound effect when player "slashes" a block.
    - I downloaded asset/sounds/sword-sound-2-36274.mp3 from pixabay anyway. Use it as the sound effect. DO NOT hard code.
    - Make sure no errors and no bugs. Make it as simple as possible. Use library if possible.
    - This webpage would be available in mobile browser and desktop browser. I am not going to make it a mobile app.
        - DO NOT USE system sound in either case.
    - Only play slashing sound when the slash is correct.
