## Phase23: Wrap up
- HelpDialogue
    - In the example, we used a row to list the BasicNumberBlock. But when the screen is too small, we cannot see the rightmost one.
        - Change the layout design, but keep the block same -- Same look with same animation
    - In the divisibility hints, use BasicNumberBlock to display the dividends.
        - When I say BasicNumberBlock, I mean BasicNumberBlock directly. Keep the look. 
    - Change the top right helpbutton, to show the text "How To Play"
    - In the starting screen of the game, include a How To Play button alongside Start Game button
