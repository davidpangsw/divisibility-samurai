## Before you starts each phase
We are going for the next phase. Remember, for each file you create or edit, make sure:
1. Changes are minimal. No unnecessary buttons, features, titles, etc.
2. The imports between files are correct.
3. No hard code except config file. All values should be configurable in the config file.
4. No compile error.
5. You should never hard-code values in our projects except in config file.
