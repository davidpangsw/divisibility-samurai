## Phase 2: Help button 
In Phase 2, we will implement the help button and help dialog.
Make sure your changes are minimal. Do not add unnecessary buttons, features, titles, etc.
1. Complete the HelpButton.
    a. If user clicks, it shows HelpDialog. 
2. Draft the HelpDialog.
    a. HelpDialog consists of two sections:
        i. How to play: Explain the rules of the game. Remember, the levels are configurable, so the rule explanation should not contain too detailed information about the levels, and should also use the parameters in config file.
        ii. Examples: Explained later. 
    b. Make it simple
        - Only contain examples of divisor 3. Some blocks should be divisible while some are not. (Do not split by divisors, this sounds very stupid. Just one divisor with several examples)
        - Game rule more simple
        - Remove repeated code or explanation or headings
