## Phase 3: BasicNumberBlock in HelpDialog Example section
In Phase 3, we will implement the number block and add it to the example section of the help dialog.
1. Implement the number block under `lib/widgets/number_blocks/`:
    a. BasicNumberBlock: It is a rectangular block that contains a number on it. The color, the fonts, etc. DO NOT implement any SIZE here. It is just a block of number.
2. Show examples using several NumberBlock in HelpDialog Example section, use a fixed-size widget to contain the number block for now. We will talk about the wrapping widget later.
