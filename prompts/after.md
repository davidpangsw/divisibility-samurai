## After each phase
For each file you created or edited, verify:
1. Changes are minimal. No unnecessary buttons, features, titles, etc.
2. The imports between files are correct.
3. No hard code except config file. All values should be configurable in the config file.
4. The project is runnable. No errors are allowed.
