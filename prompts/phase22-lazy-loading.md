## Phase22: Lazy loading
- Currently, if the network is slow, the webpage loads EXTREMELY slow. This is very bad UX. Let change the loading:
    - Use NativeSplash; Serve a spinning circle
    - Before serving the page, load flutter, all the emojis, images, pictures and sounds first. DO NOT LOAD ANY MUSIC.
    - Make sure all the flutter, all the emojis, images, pictures and sounds are loaded, then serve the page.
        - Make sure flutter is loaded!!!! User should never see a blank page
        - Make sure all the emoji required are loaded!!!! User should never see a "cross square"
        - Make sure all the images required are loaded!!!! User should never see a "cross square"
        - Make sure all the sounds required are loaded!!!! User should have all sound effects immediately any time.
    - After serving the page, simultaneously loads the music in background. In the order of study -> bronze -> silver -> gold
    - Music plays whenever suitable and loaded
