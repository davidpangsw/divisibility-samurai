## Phase 99: Brain storming
- This file is just some brain storming. They are potential future features. Read it for reference only.


- Change background in different tiers? Make the feeling different?
- Use click to generate block?
- UI/UX
    - Tune the game to become additive
    - Stats bar too many spaces, split into two. Reduce wordings like "X blocks to go" and "Y correct blocks left"

## Deployment
1. Our game is done. Do not edit any classes. Teach me how to deploy it into firebase. Just generate your answers and commands involved into the chat.
